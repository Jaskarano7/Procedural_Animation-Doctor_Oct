# Doctor-Oct-Tentacle-Player-Procedural-Animation-Controller-
A Unity project featuring a tentacle-based player character driven entirely through procedural animation.
Instead of relying on traditional keyframed movement, the playerâ€™s motion is dynamically calculated in real-time, creating fluid, organic, and adaptive interactions with the environment.

ðŸ‘‰ Current Stage: Tentacle locomotion is focused only on walking across terrain.
ðŸ‘‰ Next Stage (Planned): Expand the system to support wall climbing and obstacle traversal using procedural tentacle anchors.

âœ¨ Features :-
1) Procedural Tentacle Locomotion - Each tentacle finds its own anchor point in the environment and moves dynamically, adapting to uneven terrain.
2) Step Prediction with Physics Rays - Tentacles cast parabolic raycasts to predict where they should grab, mimicking realistic step placement.
3) Idle & Rest System - Tentacles reset naturally when the player is idle, maintaining a grounded and believable pose.
4) Adaptive Movement - Tentacle movement responds directly to player input (WASD/joystick) while maintaining balance.
5) Real-Time Foot Placement - No animations are baked â€” steps are generated on-the-fly depending on movement speed, terrain, and rotation.
6) Debug Gizmos - Visualize hit points and tentacle placement in the Unity editor for easier development & tuning.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements :-
1) Add inverse kinematics (IK) for smoother tentacle bending.
2) Procedural climbing system using tentacle anchors.
3) Support for VR controllers as tentacle inputs.
4) Physics-based grabbing and object interaction.
